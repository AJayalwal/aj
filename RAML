RAML is a relatively new REST API documentation initiative supported by MuleSoft. 
It is looks similar to advantages like WADL to some extend but with some new features. 
Itâ€™s a good approach to create a plugin for SoapUI that allows you import RAML files into SoapUI for testing of its defined APIs.
