RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) makes it easy to bring about the whole API development from design to sharing. 
Is like we can write what we need to define and reuse the same. It is machine readable API design that is actually good thing.
RAML is about REST API documentation creativity supported by MuleSoft. 
It’s a good approach to create a plugin for SoapUI that allows you import RAML files into SoapUI for testing of its distinct APIs.
It is looks similar to benefits like WADL to some extend but with some new features. 
It’s a good approach to create a plugin for SoapUI that allows you import RAML files into SoapUI for testing of its distinct APIs.

Since the core model of all these REST metadata formats is very similar (creating the plugin was rather straight-forward 
given that SoapUI already has pretty solid REST service and testing support. RAML itself uses YAML and comes with a java-parser which 
can be used to parse RAML files and resolve the described API model - the plugin uses this to resolve and traverse RAML files and 
create corresponding SoapUI objects.

Basic Things to Note while working with RAML.
-	RAML definition as a text file with a recommended extension .raml.
-	Only lower-case for methods should be used for RAML API definition
-	URI parameter, should be denoted by surrounding curly brackets in RAML
