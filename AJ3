RAML is about REST API documentation creativity supported by MuleSoft
It’s a good approach to create a plugin for SoapUI that allows you import RAML files into SoapUI for testing of its distinct APIs.

It is looks similar to benefits like WADL to some extend but with some new features.Since the core model of all these REST metadata formats is very similar (creating the plugin was rather straight-forward given
that SoapUI already has pretty solid REST service and testing support
RAML itself uses YAML and comes with a java-parser which can be used to parse RAML files and resolve the described API model
the plugin uses this to resolve and traverse RAML files and create corresponding SoapUI objects.
